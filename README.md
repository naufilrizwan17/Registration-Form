Github repository of updated file: https://github.com/naufilrizwan17/Registration-Form/blob/new_form/Registration%20Form%20for%20Coders.py
In this updated code I have changed the heading, bg and added many entry boxes. At the same time I have used radiobuttons, checkbuttons etc.
To delve into the highly sophisticated operations performed by Tkinter I highly recommend this website: https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html?highlight=tkinter#module-tkinter
It provides an in-depth detail of this library and its different functions.
Anyways this code I have written also has an additional feature which is when you click the button: START, a message prompt says: "Thank you for your time!"
